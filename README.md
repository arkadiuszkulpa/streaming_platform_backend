# Architecture Overview

The MyAI4 platform is built on a modular, scalable architecture that separates concerns across three main repositories: frontend, backend, and infrastructure. This approach enables rapid service duplication, robust security, and efficient code reuse across all MyAI4 domain services.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, serving as the template for all MyAI4 services.
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, customized with the MyAI4 design system.
- **Routing**: React Router v6, supporting domain-based navigation.
- **Authentication**: `react-oidc-context` integrated with a shared AWS Cognito User Pool for unified login across services.
- **Testing**: Vitest and React Testing Library for comprehensive unit and integration testing.
- **Service Integration**: Domain-specific API clients (e.g., `UserDataService.ts`) abstract backend communication, ensuring type safety and modularity.

### Backend

- **API Gateway**: Exposes domain-specific endpoints (e.g., `/account`, `/profile`, `/movie`, `/watchlist`, `/profile-settings`, `/profile-ai`, `/subscription`).
- **Lambda Functions**: Modular Python-based handlers for each domain, enabling separation of business logic:
  - Account management (`lambda_handler_account.py`)
  - Profile management (`lambda_handler_profiles.py`)
  - PIN-protected profile settings (`lambda_handler_profile_settings.py`)
  - AI customization per profile (`lambda_handler_profile_ai.py`)
  - Movie catalog (`lambda_handler_movies.py`)
  - Watchlist operations (`lambda_handler_watchlists.py`)
  - Subscription management (`lambda_handler_subscription.py`)
- **Database**: 11 DynamoDB tables for application data (including cross-service and streaming-specific tables), plus an AccountTable managed in the infrastructure stack.
  - Cross-service: Profile, Subscription, UserUsage
  - Profile enhancements: ProfileSettings (PIN protection), ProfileAI (custom AI settings)
  - Streaming-specific: Movie, Watchlist, WatchHistory

### Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure Stack** (`template-infra.yaml`):
  - AWS Cognito User Pool with Lambda triggers for pre-signup and post-confirmation workflows.
  - S3 and CloudFront for secure, global frontend hosting.
  - OAuth integration (including Google) and federated identity support.
  - AccountTable DynamoDB table for core account management.
  - Authentication Lambda functions for account linking and user record standardization.
- **Backend Stack** (`template-backend.yaml`):
  - API Gateway with domain-based routing.
  - Specialized Lambda functions for each service domain.
  - 11 DynamoDB tables for application data.
- **Security & Configuration**:
  - SSE encryption and point-in-time recovery enabled on all tables.
  - IAM roles follow least-privilege principles.
  - SSM Parameter Store for secure configuration, with backend stack importing values directly from the infrastructure stack for simplified deployment.
- **Cross-Stack Integration**:
  - Backend stack now directly imports all required outputs from the infrastructure stack, streamlining deployment and reducing operational complexity.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, high code reuse, and robust security, while supporting rapid expansion of new MyAI4 domain services with minimal overhead.

# Development Guidelines & Quick Start

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits landing page
2. Single "Sign in / Sign up" button redirects to Cognito Hosted UI
3. After authentication, redirects to profiles selection
4. All internal routes are protected and require authentication

### Project Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure as Code for easy service duplication
2. **Shared Components**: Reusable authentication and UI components
3. **Scalability**: AWS-native architecture that scales automatically
4. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with AWS best practices
5. **Maintainability**: Single-developer friendly with minimal overhead

## Scalability Architecture for myAI4 Services

### Shared Components Ready for Reuse
- **Authentication System**: Complete Cognito setup with Google OAuth
- **Protected Routing**: Reusable `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Base Infrastructure**: CloudFormation templates for S3/CloudFront
- **Error Handling**: `ErrorBoundary` and loading states

### Future MyAI4 Services Can Reuse
```typescript
// Shared authentication configuration
const oidcConfig = {
  authority: `https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/${POOL_ID}`,
  client_id: CLIENT_ID,
  // ... other reusable config
};

// Shared protected route component
<ProtectedRoute>
  <YourServiceComponent />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## Quick Start & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with deployment permissions
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- Access to AWS infrastructure and backend stacks

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fetch configuration from both CloudFormation stacks
npm run fetch-config:dev

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Deployment (Ready for Production)
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure stack (Cognito, S3, CloudFront)
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file template-infra.yaml \
  --stack-name myai4-infrastructure-dev \
  --parameter-overrides Environment=dev \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-west-2

# 2. Deploy backend stack (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
# Ideally using AWS CodePipeline or similar CI/CD tool, but for manual deployment:
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file template-backend.yaml \
  --stack-name myai4-backend-dev \
  --parameter-overrides Environment=dev \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region eu-west-2
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Missing Exports**: Ensure both stacks are fully deployed before running `npm run fetch-config`
- **API Errors**: Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda function issues
- **CORS Issues**: Verify API Gateway CORS configuration in backend stack
- **Authentication**: Confirm Cognito setup in infrastructure stack exports
- **Email Verification**: Ensure Google identity provider has `email_verified` in attribute mapping

## Security Considerations

- All routes except landing page require authentication
- User tokens are managed by react-oidc-context
- Logout properly clears local state and redirects to Cognito
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- CloudFront serves all assets over HTTPS
- Federated identities are properly linked to existing accounts
- User records follow standardized schema regardless of authentication method

## Authentication Flow & User Management

### Enhanced Authentication Strategy
1. **Multi-Provider Authentication**:
   - Email/Password authentication with verification
   - Google OAuth 2.0 federation
   - Account linking by email address

2. **Identity Consolidation**:
   - Prevents duplicate accounts for the same user
   
3. **Profile Security**:
   - PIN-protected profile settings for child profiles
   - Parent-controlled AI settings for family safety
   - Profile-specific AI customization with subscription tiers
   - Links Google identities to existing password accounts
   - Maintains single user record in database regardless of auth method

3. **User Record Management**:
   - Pre-signup Lambda for federated account linking
   - Post-confirmation Lambda for standardized user records
   - Consistent schema across auth methods
   - DynamoDB integration with proper IAM permissions

4. **User Experience**:
   - Seamless login regardless of previous auth method
   - Profile management independent of auth method
   - Customizable user preferences preserved across login methods
